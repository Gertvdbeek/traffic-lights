# traffic-lights
4 traffic lights simulatie using an arduino uno and 2 pcf8574 
my goal is
4 traffic lights (pcf 1) for traffic lights 1 and 2 (pcf 2) for 3 and 4
i want to make it working with arduino uno and later on using an attiny so i need a clever small code
my idea is green 7 sec orange 1,5 sec and red 20 sec rotating over 4 traffic poles
